#Summary of the Lesson-2 of Shanhowe

I don't really get something new from this lesson. Just a re-fresh for my html knowledge. 
Wait! I get something, I familiarize myself with the word "semantic" because it seems to be used commonly here. Semantic here means that some tags are there for a particular reason, we CAN use bold tag with both <b> and <strong> but their semantic meaning is different!

That's all, I think!
