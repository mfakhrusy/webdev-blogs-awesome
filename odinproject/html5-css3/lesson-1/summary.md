#Summary of the Lesson-1 of Shanhowe

First thing first, This is me back from the grave. After all the hiatus, I recently back to learn Web Development again. This time, I need to focus on mastering both HTML5 and CSS3 fluidly. I found odin project and I guess I'll take a look!. I need to master both to continue my journey to finish my JS and JQUERY learning process.

Okay, so, what do I got from lesson 1: 
1. I familiarize myself again with HTML5 and CSS3 terms and things.
2. I get one new thing: CSS Reset! I just know that this thing is obligatory for any website (or not really, but I found it to be useful). I get it from here:
