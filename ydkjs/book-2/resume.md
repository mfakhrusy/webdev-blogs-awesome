#Resume for book 2

In this 2nd series of the books, I learnt a lot of things. 
1. I learnt about some of the C-like programming concept in general which I don't particularly learnt it when I use C++ for I-Don't-Know reason. Perhaps because I don't do C++ in no other but scientific and math thingy.
2. JavaScript is weird compared to C++, but I guess my understanding of programming is being broaden by learning this exciting new language. I only know C++ (rather fluently) before this, thus the javascript knowledge I gained is really powerful of strengthening my understanding in general programming, at least!
3. Scope and things, meh, I don't give a bother with this in C++, because well, int main()!. In JavaScript we do not have int main() thus the concept is fundamentally different. We need functions, in JS, not like C/C++. Because function is a fundamental figure in JS, thorough understanding of how scope works in javascript is just as basic as function. 
4. this and that, well, it will be learnt on book 3 so I would wait to write about it! But in C++, because my main thing is numerical, I don't realllyyy give a heck about this and that. 
5. I don't really understand (partially) about the snippet in the book, lol. But I would like to continue my journey!

I guess that's all. Thank you~
